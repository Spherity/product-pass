# Introduction
Plastics currently range under the most ambiguous and most debated materials. While they are versatile, easy to produce and manufacture, and adaptable to many utilizations, the material’s ubiquity has turned it into a major problem to the environment. At the same time, political and social pressure to halt this development has emerged and becomes more and more powerful. For example, the European Union’s Circular Economy Action Plan and the Single Use Plastics Directive have been embodiments of this.  

Due to their advantages, plastics are often cheap and important enablers of other processes, e.g. as packaging. In this they are also often a rather ecologically sound solution – protecting other products (like food) or being less harmful (e.g. when compared to paper in some instances). It is the plastics waste that creates the environmental problems.  

A plastics circular economy can provide the solution. A resource efficient plastics circular economy can be characterized as keeping plastics products and materials as long in the economic cycle as possible as long as this provides an environmental advantage. To maintain its value as long as possible, the material should always be brought to the highest quality application possible, and hence avoid “downcycling” or cascadic use wherever possible.  

In the meantime, many players in the supply chain – among them plastics producers, manufacturers, recyclers, retailers, research, etc. – seek for solutions to create a functioning plastics circular economy. However, this is not an easy task. One of the challenges faced in this endeavor is information asymmetry and intransparency in the market for recycled plastics (recyclates) - a knowledge gap between producers of plastic products and plastic recyclers which leads to underperforming markets and lower amounts of high value recycling than would otherwise be possible. As a result, many plastics are either burned or landfilled.  

Overcoming this challenge could hence create new markets and applications for plastics in a circular economy. The obvious prerequisite is to create, transform and distribute the information required. A task that could be enabled by emerging digital technologies that help improving identification and traceability of plastics material, e.g. providing evidence on the specifications and qualities of a defined plastics batch. To this avail, this paper analyses the contribution of decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials to overcoming information deficits. This concept offers the opportunity to not only close the information gap, but to also make the origin of plastic material and recycling plastic traceable and verifiable. It may have therefore the potential to increase trust and transparency along the entire supply chain. 

The paper proceeds as follows. Chapter 2 discusses the problem and implications of information deficits to the establishment of a circular economy for plastics. The third chapter describes how trust and verifiability of product information can be created by decentralized identifiers. Chapter 4 illustrated how decentralized identifiers and verifiable credentials for plastic products can be applied to improve plastics recycling. The paper’s findings are discussed in chapter 5.
